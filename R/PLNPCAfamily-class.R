#' An R6 Class to represent a collection of PLNPCAfit
#'
#' @description The function [PLNPCA()] produces an instance of this class.
#'
#' This class comes with a set of methods, some of them being useful for the user:
#' See the documentation for [getBestModel()],
#' [getModel()] and [`plot()`][plot.PLNPCAfamily()].
#'
## Parameters shared by many methods
#' @param ranks the dimensions of the successively fitted models
#' @param responses the matrix of responses common to every models
#' @param covariates the matrix of covariates common to every models
#' @param offsets the matrix of offsets common to every models
#' @param weights the vector of observation weights
#' @param control list controlling the optimization and the model
#' @param formula model formula used for fitting, extracted from the formula in the upper-level call
#' @param var value of the parameter (`rank` for PLNPCA, `sparsity` for PLNnetwork) that identifies the model to be extracted from the collection. If no exact match is found, the model with closest parameter value is returned with a warning.
#' @param index Integer index of the model to be returned. Only the first value is taken into account.
