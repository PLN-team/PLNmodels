## Preliminaries

This vignette documents the data format used in **PLNmodel** by `PLN` and its variants. It also shows how to create an object in the proper format for further analyses from (i) tabular data, (ii) biom-class objects and (iii) phyloseq-class objects.

## Format description

We illustrate the format using trichoptera data set, a full description of which can be found in [the corresponding vignette](Trichoptera.html).

```{r data_load}
library(PLNmodels)
data(trichoptera)
```

The trichoptera data set is a list made of two data frames: `Abundance` (hereafter referred to as the _counts_) and `Covariate` (hereafter the _covariates_). 

```{r trichoptera_structure}
str(trichoptera, max.level = 1)
```

The covariates include, among others, the wind, pressure and humidity. 

```{r covariates_overview}
names(trichoptera$Covariate)
```

In the PLN framework, we model the counts from the covariates, let's say wind and pressure, using a Poisson Log-Normal model. Most models in R use the so-called _formula interface_ and it would thus be naturel to write something like 
```{r first_try, eval = FALSE}
PLN(Abundance ~ Wind + Pressure, data = trichoptera)
```

Unfortunately and unlike many generalized linear models, the response in PLN is intrinsically **multivariate**: it has 17 dimensions in our example. The left hand side (LHS) must encode a multivariate response across multiple samples, using a 2D-array (e.g. a matrix or a data frame). 

We must therefore prepare a data structure where `Abundance` refers to a count *matrix* whereas `Wind` and `Pressure` refer to *vectors* before feeding it to `PLN`. That's the purpose of `prepare_data`. 

```{r prepare_data_first_look}
trichoptera2 <- prepare_data(counts     = trichoptera$Abundance, 
                             covariates = trichoptera$Covariate)
str(trichoptera2)
```

If you look carefully, you can notice a few difference between `trichoptera` and `trichoptera2`:

- the first is a `list` whereas the second is a `data.frame`[^1];
- `Abundance` is a matrix-column of `trichoptera2` that you can extract using the usual functions `[` and `[[` to retrieve the count matrix;
- `trichoptera2` has an additional `Offset` column (more on that later). 

## Computing offsets

It is common practice when modeling count data to introduce an offset term to control for different sampling efforts, exposures, baselines, etc. The *proper way* to compute sample-specific offsets in still debated and may vary depending on the field. There are nevertheless a few popular methods:

- Total Sum Scaling (TSS), where the offset of a sample is the total count in that sample
- Cumulative Sum Scaling (CSS), introduced in [@CSS], where the offset of a sample if the cumulative sum of counts in that sample, up to a quantile determined in a data driven way. 
- Relative Log-Expression (RLE), implemented in [@DESeq2], where all samples are used to compute a reference sample, each sample is compared to the reference sample using log-ratios and the offset is the median log-ratio. 
- Geometric Mean of Pairwise Ratio (GMPR), introduced in [@GMPR] where each sample is compared to each other to compute a median log-ratio and the offset of a sample is the geometric means of those pairwise ratios. 

Each of these offset be computed from a counts matrix using the `compute_offset` function and changing its `offset` argument:
```{r compute_offset}
## same as compute_offset(trichoptera$Abundance, offset = "TSS")
compute_offset(trichoptera$Abundance) 
```

In this particular example, the counts are too sparse and sophisticated offset methods all fail (numeric output hidden)
```{r other_offsets, warning=TRUE, error = TRUE, results='hide'} 
compute_offset(trichoptera$Abundance, "CSS")
compute_offset(trichoptera$Abundance, "RLE")
compute_offset(trichoptera$Abundance, "GMPR")
```

We can mitigate this problem for the RLE offset by adding pseudocounts to the counts although doing so has its own drawbacks.  
```{r pseudocounts}
compute_offset(trichoptera$Abundance, "RLE", pseudocounts = 1)
```

## Building data frame using `prepare_data`

We'll already learned that `prepare_data` can join counts and covariates into a single data.frame. It can also compute offset through `compute_offset` and does so by default with `offset = "TSS"`, hence the `Offset` column in `trichoptera2`. You can change the offset method and provide additional arguments that will passed on to `compute_offset`. 

```{r prepare_data_other_offset}
str(prepare_data(trichoptera$Abundance, 
             trichoptera$Covariate, 
             offset = "RLE", pseudocounts = 1))
```

Different communities use different standard for the count data where samples are either or columns of the counts matrix. `prepare_data` uses heuristics to guess the direction of the counts matrix (or fail informatively doing so) and automatically transpose it if needed. 

Finally, `prepare_data` enforces sample-consistency between the counts and the covariates and automatically trims away:
- samples for which only covariates or only counts are available;
- samples with no positive counts

For example, if we remove the first sample from the counts and the last one from the covariates, we end up with 49 - 2  = 47 samples left, as expected. 

```{r trim_down_samples}
nrow(prepare_data(trichoptera$Abundance[-1, ], ## remove first sample
                  trichoptera$Covariate[-49,]  ## remove last sample
                  ))
```

## Importing data from biom and phyloseq objects using `prepare_data_from_[phyloseq|biom]`

Community composition data are quite popular in microbial ecology and usually stored in flat files using the [biom format](http://biom-format.org/) and/or imported in R as phyloseq-class objects [@phyloseq] using the Bioconductor [phyloseq](https://joey711.github.io/phyloseq/) package.

We provide helper functions to directly import data from a biom file (or biom-class object) and a phyloseq-class object. 


### Reading from a biom file

Note that the covariates **must** be stored in the biom object as they are automatically extracted, reading a biom without covariates results in an error. 

```{r import_biom, error=TRUE}
library(biomformat)
## Biom file without covariates
biomfile <- system.file("extdata", "min_dense_otu_table.biom", package = "biomformat")
prepare_data_from_biom(biomfile)
## Biom file with covariates, TSS offsets
biomfile <- system.file("extdata", "rich_dense_otu_table.biom", package = "biomformat")
str(prepare_data_from_biom(biomfile, offset = "TSS"))
```

### Reading from a phyloseq-class object

Note that the covariates **must** be stored in the phyloseq-class object as they are automatically extracted, importing a phyloseq object with no `sample_data` component results in an error. 

```{r import_phyloseq, error = TRUE}
library(phyloseq)
## phyloseq object without covariates
physeq <- phyloseq(otu_table(trichoptera$Abundance, taxa_are_rows = FALSE))
prepare_data_from_phyloseq(physeq)
## phyloseq object with covariates, TSS offsets
data("GlobalPatterns")
str(prepare_data_from_phyloseq(GlobalPatterns, offset = "TSS"))
```

## Mathematical details about the offsets

We detail here the mathematical background behind the various offsets and the way they are computed. Note $\mathbf{C} = (c_{ij})$ the counts matrix where $c_{ij}$ is the count of species $j$ in sample $i$. Assume that there are $J$ species in total. The offset of sample $i$ is noted $O_i$ and computed in the following way. 

### Total Sum Scaling

Offsets are simply the total counts of a sample:
$$
O_i = \sum_{j=1}^J c_{ij}
$$

### Cumulative Sum Scaling 

Positive counts are used to compute sample-specific quantiles $q_i^l$ and cumulative sums $s_i^l$ defined as
$$
q_i^l = \min \{q \text{ such that } \sum_j 1_{c_{ij} \leq q} \geq l \sum_j 1_{c_{ij} > 0} \} \qquad s_i^l = \sum_{j: c_{ij} \leq q_i^l} c_{ij}
$$
The sample-specific quantiles are then used to compute reference quantiles defined as $q^l = \text{median} \{q^i_l\}$ and median average deviation around the quantile $q^l$ as $d^l = \text{median} |q_i^l - q^l|$. The method then searches for the smallest quantile $l$ for which it detects instability, defined as large relative increase in the $d^l$. Formally, $\hat{l}$ is the smallest $l$ satisfying $\frac{d^{l+1} - d^l}{d^l} \geq 0.1$. The scaling sample-specific offset are then chosen as:
$$
O_i = s_i^{\hat{l}} / \text{median}_i \{ s_i^{\hat{l}} \}
$$
Dividing by the median of the $s_i^{\hat{l}}$ ensures that offsets are centered around $1$ and compare sizes differences with respect to the reference sample. Note also that the reference quantiles $q^l$ can be computed using either the median (default, as in the original @CSS paper) or the mean, by specifying `reference = mean`, as implemented in `metagenomeseq`. 

### Relative Log Expression

A reference sample $(q_j)_j$ is first built by computing the geometric means of each species count:
$$
q_j = \exp \left( \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i} \log(c_{ij})\right)
$$
Each sample is then compared to the reference sample to compute one ratio per species and the final offset $O_i$ is the median of those ratios:
$$
O_i = \text{median}_j \frac{c_{ij}}{q_j}
$$
The method fails when no species is shared across all sample (as all $q_j$ are then $0$) or when a sample shares less than 50% of species with the reference (in which case the median of the ratios may be null or infinite). The problem can be alleviated by adding pseudocounts to the $c_{ij}$ with `pseudocounts = 1`. 

### Geometric Mean of Pairwise Ratio 

This method is similar to RLE but does create a reference sample. Instead, each sample is compared to each other to compute a median ratio (similar to RLE)
$$
r_{ii'} = {\text{median}}_{j: c_{ij}.c_{i'j} > 0} \frac{c_{ij}}{c_{i'j}}
$$
The offset is then taken as the median of all the $r_{ii'}$:
$$
O_i = \text{median}_{i' != i} r_{ii'}
$$
The method fails when there is only one sample in the data set or when a sample shares no species with any other.
