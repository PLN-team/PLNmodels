\title{Display the criteria associated with a collection of PLNPCA fits (a PLNPCAfamily)}
\usage{
\method{plot}{PLNPCAfamily}(x, criteria = c("loglik", "BIC", "ICL"),
  annotate = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an R6 object with class PLNfamily}

\item{criteria}{vector of characters. The criteria to plot in c("loglik", "BIC", "ICL", "R_squared").
Default is  c("loglik", "BIC", "ICL").}

\item{annotate}{logical: should the value of approximated R squared be added to the plot?}

\item{...}{additional parameters for S3 compatibility. Not used}
}
\value{
Produces a plot  representing the evolution of the criteria of the different models considered,
highlighting the best model in terms of BIC and ICL.
