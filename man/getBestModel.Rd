\usage{
\method{getBestModel}{PLNPCAfamily}(Robject, crit = c("ICL", "BIC",
  "R_squared"), ...)

getBestModel(Robject, crit, ...)

\method{getBestModel}{PLNnetworkfamily}(Robject, crit = c("BIC",
  "loglik", "R_squared", "EBIC", "StARS"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{Robject}{an object with class PLNPCAfamilly ot PLNnetworkfamily}

\item{crit}{a character for the criterion used to performed the selection. Either
"BIC", "ICL", "EBIC", "StARS", "R_squared". Default is \code{ICL} for PLNPCA, and \code{BIC} for PLNnetwork.
 If StARS (Stability Approach to Regularization Selection) is chosen and stability selection
 was not yet performed, the function will call the method stability_selection with default argument.}

\item{...}{additional parameters for StARS criterion (only for PLNnetwork). stability, a scalar indicating the target stability (= 1 - 2 beta) at which the network is selected. Default is \code{0.9}.}
}
\value{
Send back an object with class \code{\link[=PLNPCAfit]{PLNPCAfit}} or \code{\link[=PLNnetworkfit]{PLNnetworkfit}}
