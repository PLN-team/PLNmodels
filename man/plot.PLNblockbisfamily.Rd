\title{Display the criteria associated with a collection of PLNblockbis fits (a PLNblockbisfamily)}
\usage{
\method{plot}{PLNblockbisfamily}(x, criteria = c("loglik", "BIC", "ICL"), reverse = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an R6 object with class \code{\link{PLNblockbisfamily}}}

\item{criteria}{vector of characters. The criteria to plot in c("loglik", "BIC", "ICL").
Default is  c("loglik", "BIC", "ICL").}

\item{reverse}{A logical indicating whether to plot the value of the criteria in the "natural" direction
(loglik - 0.5 penalty) or in the "reverse" direction (-2 loglik + penalty). Default to FALSE, i.e use the
natural direction, on the same scale as the log-likelihood.}

\item{...}{additional parameters for S3 compatibility. Not used}
}
\value{
Produces a plot  representing the evolution of the criteria of the different models considered,
highlighting the best model in terms of BIC and ICL (see details).
}
\description{
Display the criteria associated with a collection of PLNblockbis fits (a PLNblockbisfamily)
}
\details{
The BIC and ICL criteria have the form 'loglik - 1/2 * penalty'
so that they are on the same scale as the model log-likelihood. You can change this direction and use the alternate form '-2*loglik + penalty', as some authors do, by setting \code{reverse = TRUE}.

\examples{
data(trichoptera)
trichoptera <- prepare_data(trichoptera$Abundance, trichoptera$Covariate)
myBlocks <- PLNblockbis(Abundance ~ 1 + offset(log(Offset)), data = trichoptera, nb_blocks = 1:5)
\dontrun{
plot(myBlocks)
