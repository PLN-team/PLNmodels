\title{Display various ouputs (goodness-of-fit criteria, robustness, diagnostic) associated with a collection of PLNnetwork fits (a PLNnetworkfamily)}
\usage{
\method{plot}{PLNnetworkfamily}(x, type = c("criteria", "stability",
  "diagnostic"), criteria = c("loglik", "pen_loglik", "BIC", "EBIC"),
  log.x = TRUE, stability = 0.9, annotate = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an R6 object with class PLNfamily}

\item{type}{a character, either "criteria", "stability" or "diagnostic" for the type of plot.}

\item{criteria}{vector of characters. The criteria to plot in c("loglik", "BIC", "ICL", "R_squared", "EBIC", "pen_loglik").
Default is  c("loglik", "pen_loglik", "BIC", "EBIC"). Only relevant when type equals "criteria".}

\item{log.x}{logical: should the x-axis be repsented in log-scale? Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{stability}{scalar: the targeted level of stability in stability plot. Default is .9.}

\item{annotate}{logical: should the value of approximated R squared be added to the plot of criteria? Default is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{additional parameters for S3 compatibility. Not used}
}
\value{
Produces a plot  representing the evolution of the criteria of the different models considered,
highlighting the best model in terms of BIC and EBIC.
