\title{Extract edge selection frequency in bootstrap subsamples}
\usage{
extract_probs(Robject, penalty = NULL, index = NULL,
  crit = c("StARS", "BIC", "EBIC"), format = c("matrix", "vector"),
  tol = 1e-05)
}
\arguments{
\item{Robject}{an object with class PLNnetworkfamily, i.e. an output from \code{\link{PLNnetwork}}}

\item{penalty}{penalty used for the boostrap subsamples}

\item{index}{Integer index of the model to be returned. Only the first value is taken into account.}

\item{crit}{a character for the criterion used to performed the selection. Either
"BIC", "ICL", "EBIC", "StARS", "R_squared". Default is \code{ICL} for PLNPCA, and \code{BIC} for PLNnetwork.
 If StARS (Stability Approach to Regularization Selection) is chosen and stability selection
 was not yet performed, the function will call the method stability_selection with default argument.}

\item{format}{output format. Either a matrix (default) or a named vector.}

\item{tol}{tolerance for rounding error when comparing penalties.}
}
\value{
Either a matrix or named vector of edge-wise probabilities. In the latter case, edge names follow igraph convention.
}
\description{
Extracts edge selection frequency in networks reconstructed from bootstrap subsamples
during the stars stability selection procedure, as either a matrix or a named vector. In the latter
case, edge names follow igraph naming convention.
