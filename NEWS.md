# PLNmodels 1.1.0 (2024-01-08)

* Update documentation of PLN*_param() functions to include torch optimization parameters
* Add (somehow) explicit error message when torch convergence fails
* Change initialization in `variance_jackknife()` and `variance_bootstrap()` to prevent estimation recycling, results from those functions are now comparable to doing jackknife / bootstrap "by hand". 
* Merge PR #110 from Cole Trapnell to add:
  - bootstrap estimation of the variance of model parameter
  - improved interface for model initialization / optimisation parameters, which
    are now passed on to jackknife / bootstrap post-treatments
  - better support of GPU when using torch backend
* Change behavior of `predict()` function for PLNfit model to (i) return fitted values if newdata is missing or (ii) perform one VE step to improve fit if responses are provided (fix issue #114)

# PLNmodels 1.0.4 (2023-08-24)

* changed initial value in optim for variational variance (1 -> 0.1) in VE-step of PLN and PLNPCA
* fix sign in objective of VE_step for PLN with full covariance Issue #100
* add a `scale` argument compute_offset() to force the offsets (RLE, CSS, GMPR, Wrench) to be on the same scale as the counts, like TSS.
* add a new "TMM" for compute_offset()
* fix nb_param for PLNLDA, which caused wrong BIC/ICL and erratic model selection
* fix minor issues #102, #103 plus some others
* fix package file documentation as suggested in <https://github.com/r-lib/roxygen2/issues/1491>

# PLNmodels 1.0.3 (2023-07-06)

* higher tolerance on a single test (among 700) that fails on the 'noLD' 
  additional architecture on CRAN (tests without long double)

# PLNmodels 1.0.2 (2023-06-21)

* changed initial value in optim for variational variance (1 -> 0.1),
    which caused failure in some cases
* fix bug when using inception in PLNnetwork()
* starting handling of missing data
* slightly faster (factorized) initialization for PCA

# PLNmodels 1.0.1 (2023-02-12)

* fix in the use of future_lapply which used to make post-Treatments in PLNPCA last for ever with multicore in v1.0.0...
* prevent use of bootstrap/jackknife when not appropriate
* fix bug in PLNmixture() when the sequence of cluster numbers (`clusters`) is not of the form `1:K_max`
* use bibentry to replace citEntry in CITATION

# PLNmodels 1.0.0

## Breaking changes

* interface for controlling the fits now use list generated by dedicated functions
   - PLN_param() for PLN
   - PLNLDA_param() for PLNLDA
   - PLNnetwork_param() for PLNnetwork
   - PLNPCA_param() for PLNPCA
   - PLNmixture_param() for PLNmixture
The use of 'control = list()' is deprecated: the code stop and send an error.

* The regression coefficients are now denoted by B, not Theta, such as B = t(Theta).
  We keep on sending back Theta as a field of myPLN$model_par$Theta, but this will soon be deprecated

## New features

* added Barents fish data set
* support for PLN when (inverse) covariance is known/fixed
* estimator of the variance of the model parameters 
    * integration of sandwich estimator of the variance-covariance of Theta when Sigma is fixed
    * variational estimation of the variance-covariance based on variational approximation of the Fisher information 
    * jackknife estimation of the variance of Theta and Sigma
    * bootstrap estimation of the variance of Theta and Sigma
* handle list of penalty weights in PLNnetwork
* first support for torch optimizers (for PLN and PLNLDA)

* suppressing method `$latent_pos()` which is equivalent to active binding `$latent`
* finalizing integration of PLNmixture (in particular faster smoothing)
* added an argument 'reverse' to the plot methods for criteria, so that users can get their "usual" BIC definition (-2 loglik)
